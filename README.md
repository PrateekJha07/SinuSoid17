# SinuSoid17-Project-Exhibition

The challenge is simple. Build something using computer science and technology that can help solve an imminent real life problem. We're looking for projects that are powerful in their ability to change and disrupt the present in a positive way. 

HOW TO PARTICIPATE:
STEP 1.  REGISTER
Before you start working on your project, decide whether you want to work as an individual or in a team. Then, register yourself or your team before the registration deadline. No unregistered individuals/teams will be allowed to participate. Out of campus participation is also allowed in team members as well as mentors. 

STEP 2. BUILD YOUR PROJECT.
You're about to embark on an exciting journey over the next couple of months while you're building your project. After you pick a theme and finalize a project idea, you're ready to get started with building. Building can mean anything from physically putting together machine parts for a robot to writing code for a mobile app to prototyping a new prosthetic device. The possibilities are endless. After an initial build, you'll want to test it to make sure everything works the way you want it to. And after multiple retests and rebuilds, you'll finally end up with a product that you're not only proud of, but which can make a difference. 
While the building of project, every team must ensure that there progress report is submitted every fortnight which will include the details of the project work which would be completed till then. Any team failing to do so will be responsible for the deduction of their marks in the competition.

STEP 3.  SUBMIT.
Once you're satisfied with your project, you're ready to submit. Make sure you have all the necessary documents and materials you need and don't wait until the last minute to submit. After you've submitted, congratulate yourself!
